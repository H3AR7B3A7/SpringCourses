# SpringCourses
My exercises and new insights bundled together as I am reviewing previous projects and reading books while learning about best practices using Spring.

## Contains multiple projects

- Base-module: Hello world application just for testing the project structure
- Simple-rest: A simple example rest service application
- Multi-db: An application linking to 2 different databases that can be easily switched out
- Security: An application implementing Spring Security for web-api or multi-platform api (JWT)
 - The projects holds 2 branches to switch between both of these
 
Next:
