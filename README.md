# SpringCourses
My exercises and new insights bundled together as I am reviewing previous projects and reading books while learning about best practices using Spring.

## Contains multiple projects

- Base-module: Testing project structure, logger & fetching of environment variables in different ways
- Simple-rest: A simple example rest service application connecting to a mySQL database (with service tests).
- Multi-db: An application linking to 2 different databases that can be easily switched out
- Security: An application implementing Spring Security for web-api or multi-platform api (JWT)
    - The project holds 2 branches to switch between both of these
- Angular-frontend: An example of an Angular frontend connected to a Spring Boot api
- Xml-configuration: A project to get more familiar with the configuration of beans using XML instead of JavaConfig
- Starter-mail: An example of how to set up a mail-service with Spring Boot (, mailtrap.io is used for testing)
- ...
 
Next up:
- Testing: A project in which I focus on testing Spring applications
